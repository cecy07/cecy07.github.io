About Me
I am a biomedical engineer specializing in the development of AI-driven medical technologies with a focus on vestibular disorders and biosignal processing. Currently serving as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Seoul National University Hospital and Chungnam National University, I lead research initiatives that bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical clinical applications.
My research focuses on developing innovative diagnostic tools and treatment approaches for vestibular disorders using machine learning and sensor technologies. I'm particularly interested in creating accessible mobile health solutions that can improve patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.

Research Interests

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning for medical diagnostics
- Mobile health applications for screening and monitoring
- Biosignal processing and analysis
- Medical device development and integration
- Non-invasive monitoring systems
